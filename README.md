# Make my own website with R Markdown and git


## Procedure

### step 1: Git configuration

- install git

- build a folder for your new repository, Open "Command Prompt", and go to this directory.

- Run "git status", get message: fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

- Run "git init"

- Run "git config --global user.name myname"

- Run "git config --global user.email  my email"

- Run "git status" to check your status

### step 2: create a new repository in github, copy url

### step 3: Connect local and github repository

- back to "command prompt" in local computer

- Run "git remote add origin $url"

- Run "git remote â€“v" to check if remote succeed 

- Run "git branch" to check branch

### step4: create a README.md file in current folder and track it

- Run "git add README"

- Run "git status" check statuus changed

- Run "git commit README" to update README file and describe changes

- Run "git push origin master" to push to remote server





### Make the first version of your website

- Fork this repo (top-right) and rename it to be 'YOURGITHUB.github.io' (in Settings of your brand new repo).

- Get the link from cloning the repo. Use the green button "Clone" and make sure you use SSH, not HTTPS. Then, go to RStudio, create a New Project > Version Control > Git and copy this link. You have cloned your new repo as an R project.

- Build the website by running `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = "UTF-8")` or just `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B`.

- Commit and push everything from RStudio.

- Go see your new website at https://YOURGITHUB.github.io/index.html.

### Change the content of your website

- Modify `_site.yml`, `index.Rmd`, `about.Rmd`, `cv.Rmd` and `CV.pdf` with your own content. 
- Build your website again. At any moment, you can preview your website locally, by rendering your site and viewing any of your local html file in your Web Browser. 

- Commit and push everything from RStudio.

- Go see your new website with your own content at https://YOURGITHUB.github.io/.

### The blog part

For now, the 'Blog' link is giving a 404 page. 

If you want to add a static blog to your webpage, go [there](https://github.com/privefl/jekyll-now-r-template).

## Two examples

You can see for example 
- [my own website](https://privefl.github.io/),

- [the website of the R user group in Grenoble](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).

## Conclusion

As a reminder, all credit goes to the geniuses at RStudio (thanks also to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)). I just made some minor modifications and made a tuto about how to use all this together.

If anything is false or not clear enough, feel free to contact me or open an issue.
If it is an issue only related with R Markdown, you'll find a better answer posting [there](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown).
