# **PROFILE**  
I am now mainly contributing to research on 

* Genome wide association studies focus on pregnancy-related outcomes (placenta weight, birth weight and gestational duration) and selected childhood diseases (febrile seizure, psychiatric disease, epilepsy, metabolic disease, and congenital heart defect)  
* Polygenic risk score estimation
* Linear regression and Logistic regression analysis
* Mendelian randomization analysis for Birth weight and psychiatric disease
* Integrate Single-cell RNA sequencing data with genome-wide association results to distinguishes disease association cells
  
PhD and 5 years postdoc experience in **Quantitative Genetics and Genomics**. I was mainly contributing to research focusing on  

*  Quantitative genetics and genomics  
*  Population genetics  
*  Statistical genetics

I can offer  

*  Years of experience in both **human genetics** and **animal breeding and genetics**  
*  Years of experience on bioinformatics and post-GWAS analysis  
*  Years of experience research within the field of genome wide association analysis and genomic prediction  
*  Knowledge about different statistical genetic models - linear mixed model, Bayesian model and logistic regression model.
*  Experience in handling large data set, such as whole genome sequence data and different density of SNP-chip data   
*  Rich experience with linux, R, and python   
*  Rich experience in reproducible research using Snakemake and conda
  
I thrive in diverse, team-based environments, and comfortable with leading and being led.
